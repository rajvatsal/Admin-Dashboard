<h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>This was tough from aligning grid items to making it look good, giving it unique flare.
    I struggled a lot in design and making it responsive took a lot of time but in the end I pushed through it and 
    I am really happy with the result.</p>
<h1>What did I learn?</h1>
    <p>I've got pretty good grasp at grid now. Now I understand the difference between grid and flex box more clearly and know when to use either one of them or both, use flex when you just want your content decide the layout for you it's flexible and has nice animations too!!!. Grid is more rigid you keep the layout and your content flows within a grid. None of them is better than the other one they both have use cases and it's up to the programmer which one he chooses to use. I can see myself using both of them and I will continue to try to use the right tool for the right job and not be biased. I am also much better a making my webpage responsive. I also learned about new things like masking, event delegation, radial gradient, getting location of your cursor relative to both an element and the viewport.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>I consider this project 70 to 80 percent finished. I like the design and probably won't change it. I will
    keep adding new project links that I will make in the future.
